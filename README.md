You have an option in the official app of the Tam Montpellier, it's a personal experience to done this type of applications.

* You have all flags in color which is a park for Velo mag, you can click on a flag to view this information (places available and many other things...)

* You have also a button to zoom on your localization to view the parks around you.

Build:
