Where would you can let your bike from Tam in Montpellier

You have an option in the official app of the Tam Montpellier, it's a personal experience to done this type of applications.

* You have all flags in color which is a park for Velo mag, you can click on a flag to view this information (places available and many other things...)

* You have also a button to zoom on your localization to view the park around you.

Build:
* Android : OK.
* IOS: Almost done, I have a little problem when I want to get the xml data.
